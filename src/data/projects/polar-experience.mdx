## Overview

Polar Experience is a company run by the amazing Dixie Dansercoer, Belgium's
record-holding polar traveler, and Julie Brown that offers tailored polar
expeditions and polar training. They approached me to help them with a
rebranding of their existing Polar Circles and Polar Experience brands.

## Approach

The purpose of the exercise was to explore and define a new overarching visual
identity for Polar Circles and Polar Experience that could easily be used across
different materials and brand touchpoints, from physical to digital. The main
design objective was to emphasize simplicity, honesty, and modernity.

At the core of the brand is the logo mark. A remarkably simple design built from
a set of geometrical circles that refer to the old Polar Circles brand and
symbolize the earth's North and South Poles.

I've decided to integrate a modern, dynamic, and colorful design style that
would elevate the brand in a more polished and energetic way.

## New website

To further strengthen their position in a fast-evolving and changing market,
I've also designed, and closely collaborated with my Front-end Development
partner, an accompanying website. The approach here was to give the visitors
their own digital polar experience through browsing the website by integrating
bold imagery, immersive videos, intriguing interactions, and slick transitions.
