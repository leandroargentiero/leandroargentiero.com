title: "Building a Covid-19 realtime dashboard"
description:
  "In March 2020 Belgium went into her first full Lockdown due to the
Coronavirus pandemic, suddenly giving us a lot of free time. I've decided to use
that extra free time to good use and brush up on my front-end skills. After
stumbling upon a public API from the American Johns Hopkins University, I took
the opportunity to create a real-time dashboard that displays the official data."

## Approach

Used technologies:

- React.js (Create React App)
- React Hooks
- Styling with Styled Components
- Deployed on Netlify

## Result

This little side project gave me the opportunity to play around and understand
the used technologies. Giving me practical experience that I could use on my
daytime job where I could assist my front-end engineer colleague in UI
development of the design system project at Mediahuis.
