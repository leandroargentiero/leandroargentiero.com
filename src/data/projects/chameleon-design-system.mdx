## Overview

Mediahuis, as the name suggests, is a collection of a multitude of (media)
brands. In the past, for every new product or feature, both design and
development have always created bespoke, tailor-made solutions. This practice
created an unmanaged growth of different implementations. With no apparent
structure behind it. Resulting in a product portfolio with an inconsistent user
experience and a development workflow that was difficult to scale.

## The Challenge

How might we create a system that will introduce design consistency and
development efficiency?

## Approach

Before diving into any design tool or code editor, it was important to realize a
business buy-in by giving numerous presentations to stakeholders to get them
acquainted with design systems and convince them why they should invest in it at
all. When we performed a UI and CSS audit, we found many inconsistencies.
Multiply this by every piece of UI and many years of development, and we
realized how inconsistent, incomplete, and difficult to maintain the current
workflow had become. After getting the final approval we started the project and
established a multi-disciplinary product team that was solely responsible for
creating and maintaining the design system. A product owner, a frontend engineer
and myself as a designer/developer.

## Meet Chameleon

Chameleon is Mediahuis' multibranded design system providing ready to use tools
and components for building high-quality, consistent user experiences.

Chameleon's goal is to enable streamlined communication. If developers learn to
think like designers, and designers learn to think like developers, the process
of delivering a new product can be agile from start to finish.

When designers don't have to focus on the low-level components anymore, this
frees up time. They can use this time to craft carefully thought-out user flows,
prototype faster and iterate more quickly with priority on the user experience.
On the other hand, this gives developers extra time to focus on accessibility
and stability.

## Multibranding

Chameleon gets its name from its adaptability. With Mediahuis being a collection
of a multitude of brands, the design system needed to support multibranding out
of the box. Like a real chameleon, it easily blends in with the context it finds
itself in.

## Built according to the Foundations Model

The first step towards creating a single source of truth is establishing what we
regarded as the foundations of a brand. These foundations are a set of
agreed-upon primitive values that can be seen as the DNA for a specific brand.

These values are what enable brands to differentiate themselves, as brands are
given the freedom to adapt these core values according to their branding
strategy.

We decided to structure our system according to Atomic Design's methodology. A
modular design concept that has distinct stages and is ordered in a hierarchical
way. By creating this collection of parts, designers can re-use components
across projects. This re-use ensures consistency and allows a designer to focus
on the more intricate and subtle change that attribute to top-notch user
experiences.

## Bridging the gap between design and development

To create a bridge between design and development, we translated all foundations
into a Design Token architecture in JSON values. These values are then converted
to platform-specific tokens that can subsequently be used in different
components and platforms.

## Faster onboarding of new brands

Fueled by Chameleon's Design Token architecture, the framework made it also
possible to onboard a new brand in a matter of gathering the needed branded
foundation values, running the assembly and out comes a fully functional brand
with ready-to-use components.

## Educating designers and developers

To optimize the effectiveness of the communication between designers and
developers, they not only need to speak the same language; they also need to
employ the same mental model. If both worlds have the same way of thinking and
grasp the same abstract concepts, discussions can cut right to the core of the
underlying issue. Both design and development guidelines are provided to help
with the design system.

## The result

Chameleon Design System is successfully integrated with different product/design
teams. Providing them with a powerful toolbox that ensures an optimized
workflow, consistency across the product portfolio, and reducing overall
development time.
