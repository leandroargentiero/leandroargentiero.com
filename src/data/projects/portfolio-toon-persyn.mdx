description:
  'A good friend of mine, a professional director of photography, needed a
  portfolio website where he could display his work. One of the requirements was
  that he could update and change the website himself. For me, this was the
  perfect opportunity to test out some new technologies and provide him with a
  blazing fast website built with a modern tech stack.'
