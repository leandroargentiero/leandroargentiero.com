## Overview

A good friend of mine, a professional director of photography, needed a
portfolio website where he could display his work. One of the requirements was
that he could update and change the website himself. For me, this was the
perfect opportunity to test out some new technologies and provide him with a
blazing fast website built with a modern tech stack.

## Used technologies

- Next.js
- TailwindCSS
- Prismic Headless CMS
- Framer Motion
- Deployed on Vercel

## Features

### Dark mode

The website's theme automatically adapts to the user's system setting to provide
a better reading experience during night time.

### Incremental Static regeneration

All pages are statically built for faster load times and seamless navigation.
Incremental Static Regeneration
([ISR](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration))
enables me to use static-generation on a per-page basis, without needing to
rebuild the entire site whenever the client updates data in Prismic.

### Dynamic Routing

The project detail pages are statically pre-rendered from predefined path.
