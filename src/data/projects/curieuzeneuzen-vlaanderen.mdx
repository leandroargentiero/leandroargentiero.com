## Overview

De Standaard is on of the leading newspapers in Belgium. In 2018, I've helped
them with designing and building an interactive map with 20.000 data points
spread over the cities, towns, and countryside of Flanders mapping the air
pollution created by cars. Visitors could search for the dot on the street for
their house, their parents' and their children's school.

## Approach

After a kick-off meeting where we gathered all requirements, I started with
creating wireframes, mapping out the user experience. After validating the
wireframes, I designed a prototype that was used to gather early user feedback.

During this project I, together with another developer, had the opportunity to
take the responsibility on the technical part. Giving me the chance to create an
end-to-end solution that met the editorial team's requirements.

## Used technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript
- Mapbox
- Custom Tile Server

## Result

On launch day only, 650.000 unique visitors spent 1 million minutes on this map.
Making it the **most visited application** in the publisher's digital history
and eventually resulting in **winning a 'Belfius Persprijs'** in the category of
Digital Press.
