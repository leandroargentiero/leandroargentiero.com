## Overview

During the lockdown, I immersed myself in the art of making homemade pizzas.
Everything starts with creating your dough by only mixing water, flour, salt,
and yeast. What seems simple is actually a complex process where getting the
right amounts and time is crucial. During preparation, I've found myself
constantly looking up the correct ratios, and that's where the idea came from to
build a handy app called **Pizza Point** that does the calculations for me.
