## Overview

TADAAM is a Telenet venture that specializes in providing home internet and
television services through mobile technology. Offering a hassle-free and fast
setup, users enjoy internet and TV connectivity that accompanies them wherever
they go, without the need for cables or technicians.

## The Challenge

TADAAM encountered obstacles in its rapid growth and success. While the initial
phase supported the startup's early growth, it proved to be non-scalable as user
demands expanded. The complexity of maintaining the systems increased and was,
after a mishap during a payment provider migration, unmanageable. This challenge
highlighted the need for a more robust and scalable solution. As a response, a
complete overhaul of the development team took place, and the <u>decision was
made to rebuild everything from the ground up</u>.

I contributed to the project in the following ways:

- Playing a key role in <b>Frontend Development</b>
- Took charge of <b>UX/UI Design</b> (due to absence of a dedicated designer)
- Contributed to <b>Backend Development</b>

## New onboarding experience

To enhance user experience, we introduced a new modern design and a multistep
registration flow. We integrated Auth0 for secure authentication, and Stripe for
seamless payments, and established a connection with our logistics partner to
ensure smooth deliveries of the TADAAM Boxes.

## My TADAAM

We created a dashboard for existing customers to conveniently manage their
accounts. They can easily handle their subscriptions, pause or cancel services
at any time, all through the My TADAAM portal.

## TADAAM Admin

We also developed a backoffice application to streamline day-to-day operations
across <u>four different departments</u>:

For our <b>customer support team</b> we created a central hub that helped with
their efficiency and effectiveness in addressing customer needs.

We simplified inventory management, package creation, package returns, and
package refurbishment processes for our <b>warehouse team</b>.

Another module catered to our <b>retail shops</b>, providing tools to enhance
their operations and customer interactions.

To gather valuabe insights and improve marketing strategies for the <b>marketing
team</b>, a survey builder module was developed.

## TADAAM Component Library

To ensure consistency across all applications, we created a centralized
component library in Storybook. Because of the urgency of the project, we
decided to bootstrap the library with Chakra UI and customized it to fit our own
needs.
