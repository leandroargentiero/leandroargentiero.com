## Overview

In 2022 I decided it was finally time to design a brand new portfolio website
that would serve as my digital garden and a place to showcase some of my work. I
believe that one of the best ways to learn programming skills is by just doing
it. Therefore, whenever I start a new personal project, I like to try out new
technologies and put them into practice. Since I was already familiar with
building projects in Javascript, I thought this project would be an ideal
opportunity to try Typescript. It helped me document my code and forced me to
use the correct types, decreasing bugs and improving productivity without
leaving my IDE.

## Design first mindset

Whenever starting a new development project, it is always tempting to dive into
VS Code immediately and start building out your ideas. But what I learned from
being a designer is that you can not begin without having a clear vision of what
you're going to make. You can not build a house without the necessary
foundation.

## Low fidelity mock-ups

To get a high-level idea, I always start with sketching some wireframes. Staying
low-fidelity keeps you focused on hierarchy and functionality without being
distracted by more complex UI decisions like colors, typography, icons, etc. For
wireframing, I like to use [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/).

## New branding means new logo

I'm grateful to be able to work with some talented and inspiring people, and I
was lucky to get some help from [Molden](https://www.molden.studio), who
designed this beautiful custom font.

## Laying the foundations

For the overall look & feel, I aimed for simplicity and minimalism, with a
sprinkle of playfulness. For the colors, I took inspiration from the sunrise and
sunset (which are my favorite moments during the day).

## High fidelity

My weapon of choice for high-fidelity UI design is
[Figma](https://www.figma.com).
