  'Mediahuis, as the name suggests, is a collection of a multitude of (media)
  brands. In the past, for every new product or feature, both design and
  development have always created bespoke, tailor-made solutions. This practice
  created an unmanaged growth of different implementations. With no apparent
  structure behind it. Resulting in a product portfolio with an inconsistent
  user experience and a development workflow that was difficult to scale.'

## The Challenge

How might we create a system that will introduce design consistency and
development efficiency?

## Approach

Before diving into any design tool or code editor, it was important to realize a
business buy-in by giving numerous presentations to stakeholders to get them
acquainted with design systems and convince them why they should invest in it at
all. When we performed a UI and CSS audit, we found many inconsistencies.
Multiply this by every piece of UI and many years of development, and we
realized how inconsistent, incomplete, and difficult to maintain the current
workflow had become. After getting the final approval we started the project and
established a multi-disciplinary product team that was solely responsible for
creating and maintaining the design system. A product owner, a frontend engineer
and myself as a designer/developer.

## Meet Chameleon

Chameleon is Mediahuis' multibranded design system providing ready to use tools
and components for building high-quality, consistent user experiences.

Chameleon's goal is to enable streamlined communication. If developers learn to
think like designers, and designers learn to think like developers, the process
of delivering a new product can be agile from start to finish.

When designers don't have to focus on the low-level components anymore, this
frees up time. They can use this time to craft carefully thought-out user flows,
prototype faster and iterate more quickly with priority on the user experience.
On the other hand, this gives developers extra time to focus on accessibility
and stability.
